## Summary

React website built using Vite, React, Firebase, Tensorflow.js and Tailwind CSS.
It features the following:

* Fully functioning authentication system with sign-in, login and password reset options.
* Modern and responsive design for all devices.
* Integrated ML Image Classifier in the browser.

Website layout is inspired from current start-up trends, such as bento boxes placed one next </br>
to each other or on two offset columns, as seen on the roadmap section.

Once the user creates an account through the sign-in option, he'll be able to access the ML </br>
Model and test it uploading images through URLs or from his local device. </br>
The Image Classifier model was trained using [Microsoft's Azure Custom Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/products/ai-services/ai-custom-vision), </br>
the model was then exported into tensorflow.js format and then integrated in the website's logic </br>
to make predictions.

The model can predict the following dog species: Afghan - African Wild Dog - Airedale -
American Hairless - American Spaniel - Basenji - Basset - Beagle - Bearded Collie -
Bermaise - Bichon Frise - Bienheim -  - Bloodhound - Bluetick - Border Collie - Borzoi -
Boston Terrier - Boxer - Bull Mastiff - Bull Terrier.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
